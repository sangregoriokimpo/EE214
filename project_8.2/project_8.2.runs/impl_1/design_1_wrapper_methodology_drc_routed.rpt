2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/counter_0/inst/DFF1/Q_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/counter_0/inst/DFF2/Q_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/counter_0/inst/DFF3/Q_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/counter_0/inst/DFF4/Q_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O, design_1_i/clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rst relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>
