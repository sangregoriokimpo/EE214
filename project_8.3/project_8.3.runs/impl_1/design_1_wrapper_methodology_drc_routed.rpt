CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O, design_1_i/clk
Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#1 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of 2.000 ns has been defined on port 'rst' relative to clock clk for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
